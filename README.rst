Python-CANBus
=============
Python-CANBus is a Python package that abstracts communication to CAN Bus Network interface devices.

I have decided to stop working on this project.  Instead I am using the python-can package.  It
does everything that I wanted this project to do and is much more mature.

The python-can package can be found here <https://github.com/hardbyte/python-can>
